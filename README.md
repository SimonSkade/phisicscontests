# physicscontests

This is the source code of a website that hosts physics contests. It is kind of like coding competitions, but with physics problems.

## How to run

I will create a requirements.txt file and restructure the repository soon.

You can try to run it already from the command line, but you may need some additional libraries.

```
python manup_template/app.py
```

## License

This website is created from a template from colorlib. You are not allowed to remove the copywrite at the bottom of the website (except if you buy a license from colorlib).
