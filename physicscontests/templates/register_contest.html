                        <li><span class="icon_check"></span> Normally, you should only participate on your own, but since this is kind of a demo-test-version, teamwork is ok.</li>
                        <li><span class="icon_check"></span> Please do not hack the website or the server, I know that it is not secure yet.</li>
                        <li><span class="icon_check"></span> Do not publish results until the end of the contest.</li>
                        <li><span class="icon_check"></span> You will need to enter a number as an answer for each task. Your answer will be judged as correct if the relative error is less or equal to one hundredth, so you need to enter at least three significant digits. (Make sure to write decimal numbers with a dot, not a comma)</li>
                        <li><span class="icon_check"></span> You are allowed to look up some mathematical definitions and physical constants (eg. on the Internet)</li>
                        <li><span class="icon_check"></span> Please do not brute-force the solution, do not solve equations numerically (except if it is explicitly said in the statement), and do not look up similar problems.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Make sure to reload the page when the contests starts.</p>
                    <p>Have much fun and good luck!</p>
